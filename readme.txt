----- Note to TA -----

1. I have compiled the program using my IDE Visual studio editor where JDK environment setup is installed. 
If you have the same environment you can just hit the run button in the main class file which is "payrollApp.java"
If not please make sure to specify the real path for the jdk package and compile the entire package with all classes together.

2. The user input type is int. You will encounter exception error if string or character is entered.

3. The app provides 3 functions including payroll information, payroll averages, and payroll maximum/mimimum as per the instructions.

4. In the design, I have talked about buttons and GUI interface. However, I asked the professor and he told me you can implement it 
with GUI or terminal. Thus, I picked the terminal output instead of the GUI but the functionality and the overall design is the same.

5. Please refer to the screenshots for how to use the payroll app if needed or let me know if there is bigger concern.

Thank you !
